# Machine-Learning-Model-to-Predict-CTR-with-Python

This project is aimed at building machine learning models to predict click-through rates (CTR) based on historical marketing data.
The model performances are measured using statistical metrics such as  MSE, RMSE, MAE and R-squared.

The problem was approached from a regression standpoint due to the CTR feature being a continuous variable. 
The machine learning algorithms implemented include:

- Linear regression
- Decision Tree Regressor
- Random Forest Regressor
- XGBoost Regressor
  
The impact of the model features on prediction values was analysed using SHAP values and visualisation (beeswarm, waterfall)
